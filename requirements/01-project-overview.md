## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Limited by LLM context windows (currently 128k tokens max)
- Mobile devices require minimum 4GB RAM
- Local deployment requires 16GB+ RAM for quality models

### Business Constraints
- Initial budget limited to infrastructure costs
- Reliance on open-source models for cost efficiency
- Content moderation requirements for public deployment

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| LLM hallucinations | High | Medium | Implement fact-checking, clear disclaimers |
| Character IP issues | High | Low | Focus on public domain figures, original characters |
| Scalability challenges | Medium | Medium | Cloud-native architecture, caching strategies |
| User adoption | High | Medium | Strong marketing, influencer partnerships |
| Technical complexity | Medium | Low | Leverage existing solutions (Open WebUI, Ollama) |
